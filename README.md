This project focuses on sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques to analyze and classify the sentiment of text data. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately classify the sentiment of given text as positive, negative, or neutral. The analysis is performed using Python and various machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset can be found on Kaggle at the following link: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews). It contains the code, explanations, and step-by-step instructions to perform sentiment analysis using Python.

## Prerequisites

To run the code and reproduce the sentiment analysis, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE of your choice

The following Python libraries are required as well:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk

These libraries can be installed using pip with the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
```

Additionally, you may need to download NLTK data by executing the following code in a Python environment:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
```

## Project Structure

The Dataset on Kaggle includes a single notebook that contains all the necessary code, explanations, and instructions to perform sentiment analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis Workflow

The sentiment analysis workflow typically includes the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the text data, remove noise, and perform necessary transformations such as lowercasing, stemming, or lemmatization.

2. Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features that machine learning algorithms can understand. Common techniques include bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.

3. Model Selection and Training: Select suitable machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

4. The pretrained LLM for Hugging face (roberta model) was used to compare the results.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
